        Now you can append saved card list to your current list of cards.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="post_content">
        In the Random Card Generator we have made available an arbitrary number of random cards to be generated.<br>
        Bare in mind that there is still a limit of 1800 cards to be played at any given session.<br>
        You can choose directly the number of cards you want to generate by just cliking in the displayed number and then accept from the phone keyboard.

        UBV now features Social Media Sign In.<br>
        When you login in UBV, your sets of saved cards, and your custom patterns sets are backed up in our Google Cloud Servers. This allows for easy Device synchronization, if you want to change
        device for any reason, just login in the new device and your game will be restored as you left it in the other device.
        <br>
        Although you may use UBV in multiple devices at a time while logged in with your account, you SHOULD NOT, using multiple devices at a time will cause irrecoverable loss of data.
        <br>
        If for any reason you really need to use both devices at a time, make sure to disconnect the secondary device from the internet just right after synchronization, and up until the end of the
        session, this will avoid conflict of data.
        <br>
        When you delete or save any of the afore mentioned files, they will be deleted/saved as well in other devices that have logged with your account, as soon as you open UBV with an active
        internet connection.
    </p>
    <p class="post_content">
        UBV now has the list of the Open Source Software that makes UBV posible, you can find this list in the section "About UBV".

    <div class="content">- Thursday, August 15th, 2019 - <strong>I単aki 2.6.0</strong></div>
    <p class="post_content">
        We are making available in UBV the "Community Patterns", this is a series of Custom patterns that extend the
        patterns you can play with UBV. This patterns will be available to you as soon as you connect to a wifi network,
        if using data in your mobile, you can download and install the "Community Patterns" by going to the "Custom
        Patterns" section; there will be a cloud icon like, that wil allow you to download and install the "Community
        Patterns" on mobile data.
        <br />
        These patterns will prove more useful for the users that have UPGRADED UBV, as they require that you have
        "multi-selection" enabled. All you have to do is load the list of patterns from the menu and then with
        "multi-selection" enabled select them all.
        One of the main features of the "Community Patterns" is that unlike the patterns that you have created, once any
        of them are bingoed, the rest will be deselected at once, instead of doing it mannually.
        Currently the "Community Patterns" include:
        <br>
        <br> -
        <strong>Any Corner</strong>
        <br> -
        <strong>Any Block of 4</strong>
        <br> -
        <strong>Any Block of 6</strong>
        <br> -
        <strong>Any Chevron</strong>
        <br> -
        <strong>Doble Bingo</strong>
        <br> -
        <strong>Doble Bingo Hard Way</strong>
        <br> -
        <strong>Triple Bingo</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="post_content">
        We are also removing the folder "UBV" that was located in previous versions in the root of your internal memory
        card. Starting with UBV "I単aki 2.6.0", all temporary data generated by the usage of UBV, will be located in the
        "data" folder for UBV in the internal memory. These files are generated by UBV as temporary files or to store
        files that you create, such as Custom Patterns or Card Sets. Now that we are moving away from your
        SD card whenever you have the need to uninstall UBV, there will be no traces left behind from Ultimate Bingo
        Verifier when you uninstall the application.
